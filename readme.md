# ForerunnerDB Core
This project contains the core query/match/update functionality
that is a standalone engine and can be used for any purpose.

>forerunnerdb-core provides the core of ForerunnerDB 3.0 which
>is a complete rewrite of ForerunnerDB in ES6 instead of ES5 and
>has simplicity, modularity and extensibility as the primary
>pillars of development.

Right now, this project is still in development but is usable.
Because of this, there is no documentation. You can check out
the unit tests to see how to use various parts of the core
engine.
